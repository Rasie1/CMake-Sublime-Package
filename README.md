CMake Sublime Package
=====================

Very simple package to provide syntax highlighting and auto-indentation support while
editing [CMake](http://www.cmake.org) files in [Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com)

Installation
============
Either manually put this in your Sublime package folder, or use the plugin 
[Package Control](https://sublime.wbond.net/installation) to install directly from this git repository.
